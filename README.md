Using maps and scatterplots in Tableau

<b> What did we learn? </b>
1. Join 2 tables in the physical layer.
2. Made a hierarchy.
3. Change the limits(start and end) of colors.
4. Apply the same filter across multiple worksheets.
5. Change transparency of colors for overlapping dots in the scatterplots.
6. Created a dashboard for the first time.
7. Add a new container to the dashboard.
8. Making interactive dashboards using Actions(Filtering, Highlighting).
9. Use 1 worksheet 'As a filter'/ generated actions.
10. Creating an action manually.
11. Difference between Filtering and Highlighting. Filtering filters the rows in the data based on the selected data and shows that in the scatterplot. However, highlighting doesnt work that way, and it will highlight customers based on the level fo granularity.
